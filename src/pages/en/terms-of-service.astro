                    <h2>IV. Cancellation Policy and the "4-Hour Rule"</h2>
                    <p>
                        TPP incurs costs related to room reservation,
                        specialist's working time, and infrastructure (so-called
                        readiness to provide service costs).
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Cancellation or Rescheduling:</strong> The Client
                            has the right to cancel or reschedule the visit free of
                            charge no later than <strong>4 hours</strong> before its
                            scheduled start. This can be done via the online system
                            or by contacting the Reception.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Late Cancellation or No-Show:</strong> In the
                            event of cancelling the visit less than 4 hours before
                            the appointment or failing to appear, the paid amount
                            is non-refundable. It covers the costs incurred by TPP
                            for organization and blocking the slot, which cannot be
                            resold to another Client.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        For visits to be paid on-site, failure to cancel in time
                        results in an obligation to settle the fee at the next
                        visit or the issuance of a debit note.

                            a) Preparation of an Opinion (e.g., for court,
                            school) is a separate service governed by a separate
                            written agreement concluded after an initial
                            consultation with the Opinion Expert.

                            b) The fee for the Opinion is collected in advance.
                            The document serves as a private (out-of-court)
                            opinion or an ad hoc expert opinion (if ordered by a
                            court).

                            diagnostic process has begun does not entitle the
                            Client to a refund (due to the specialist work
                            already performed).

                            are issued for a fee (according to the Price List)
                            and solely based on facts (attendance).

                        <li>
                            b) The fee is paid before the document is issued.
                            TPP does not correct the content of certificates at
                            the Client's request if such requests contradict the
                            facts.

                        <strong>Competency Courses:</strong> Participation in courses
                        (e.g., for parents, couples) is governed by separate Course
                        Regulations signed before the training begins.

                        TPP Specialist – not being a medical doctor – is obliged
                        to call Emergency Services (112) and terminate the
